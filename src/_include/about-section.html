    <h3 class="page-title-h3 about-text-block__title">We believe that
      small can be big</h3>
    <p class="page-text about-text-block__text">Sparkinity was born because we believe in innovation.
    Data shows that small stores are better positioned than ever to take on retail giants as consumers  increasingly seek curation and a personalised touch. Agility is a powerful weapon and we seek to empower the agile.
    </p>
    <p class="page-text about-text-block__text">​But to fulfil our vision we need to disrupt the age old system of distribution & wholesale. Our founding team has personal experiences & understanding  of the  expenses incurred , time and incredible effort that both buyers  & makers  make  to connect. All because of the need to get a physical glimpse of that  unicorn called the bestseller before risking an order.
    </p>
    <p class="page-text about-text-block__text">​We are changing  the buying process by providing retailers a medium to order online with free returns. Makers save on huge upfront costs for creating distribution networks  &  store owners can easily let their customers decide without taking on the risks involved with buying decisions.
